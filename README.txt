## Emory Machine Learning (CS344) Code Repository

This repo holds the code I wrote for my assignments and final project in Emory's CS334 Machine Learning class. This is a foundational machine learning class
that covers the most common supervised ML techniques. The topics covered in this class include:
1. KNN
2. Decision Trees
3. Model Assessment/Selection
4. Bias/Variance Tradeoff
5. Feature Selection
6. Linear/Logistic Regression
7. Dimension Reduction
8. Ensemble Methods
9. Support Vector Machines
10. Neural Networks

The homeworks are designed to test our ability to implement certain algorithms by hand, as well as utilize existing libraries. The final project 
allows us to apply what we have learned in this course to a real-world task. All code will pushed here as it is completed. The homework (hw<num>-nhvasan) 
topics are as follows:
1. hw1-nhvasan: KNN/Feature Pre-processing
2. hw2-nhvasan: Decision Tree Implementation (from scratch)
3. hw3-nhvasan: Closed Form Linear Regression + Stochastic Gradient Descent Linear Regression (from scratch)
